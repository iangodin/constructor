Constructor
===========

A python-based program that is similar to cmake or configure
in that it is used to generate actual build files customized
for the build machine. Unlike either, it uses a simple
function and list like syntax to define the build targets.

It was primarily created to build ninja (http://martine.github.com/ninja/)
files, but should be general purpose enough to use for
other systems.
